# Overview Section Writing Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the standard format and guidelines for writing overview sections in all specification documents. The overview section provides a comprehensive introduction to the component, explaining its purpose, responsibilities, and role in the domain.

## Section Structure

### Standard Format

```markdown
## Overview

[Comprehensive description of the component's purpose, responsibilities, and domain role]

**Base Class**: [Reference to base class if applicable]

**Important**: [Critical information or requirements]
```

### Content Elements

1. **Purpose Statement**: What the component does
2. **Responsibilities**: Key responsibilities and capabilities
3. **Domain Role**: How it fits into the domain model
4. **Business Context**: Why it exists and its business value
5. **Key Characteristics**: Important properties or behaviors
6. **Base Class Reference**: If extending a base class
7. **Important Notes**: Critical requirements or constraints

## Writing Guidelines

### Purpose Statement

- Start with what the component represents
- Use clear, descriptive language
- Focus on business value, not technical implementation
- Explain the component's primary function

### Responsibilities

- List the main responsibilities
- Use bullet points or numbered lists
- Be specific about what the component does
- Focus on business capabilities

### Domain Role

- Explain how it fits into the domain model
- Describe relationships with other components
- Mention the component's architectural layer
- Clarify its role in business processes

### Business Context

- Explain why the component exists
- Describe the business problems it solves
- Mention business rules it enforces
- Connect to business value

### Key Characteristics

- Highlight important properties
- Mention unique behaviors
- Describe constraints or invariants
- Explain special requirements

## Content Requirements

### Length and Detail

- **Length**: 2-4 paragraphs typically
- **Detail Level**: Comprehensive but concise
- **Focus**: Business value and purpose
- **Tone**: Professional and clear

### Language Requirements

- Use domain language, not technical jargon
- Write in active voice
- Be specific and concrete
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

### Structure Requirements

- Start with purpose statement
- Follow with responsibilities
- Include domain role and context
- End with key characteristics

## Examples

### Entity Overview

```markdown
## Overview

The Task entity represents a single task in the todo application, encapsulating task state, business rules, and lifecycle management. It serves as the primary aggregate root for task-related operations and ensures data integrity through validation and domain event emission.

**Base Class**: Extends `Entity<Id>` to inherit common functionality for identity management, domain event handling, lifecycle tracking, and entity comparison.

The Task entity enforces business rules such as task status transitions, assignment validation, and completion criteria. It maintains relationships with users, projects, and other domain objects while providing a consistent interface for task operations across the application.
```

### Value Object Overview

```markdown
## Overview

The TaskTitle value object encapsulates the title of a task with validation rules and formatting constraints. It ensures that task titles meet business requirements and provides a type-safe way to handle task naming throughout the domain.

**Base Class**: Extends `ValueObject<string>` to inherit common functionality for immutability, equality comparison, and serialization.

TaskTitle enforces business rules such as minimum and maximum length requirements, character restrictions, and formatting standards. It provides a consistent interface for task naming while ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid titles from entering the system.
```

### Domain Service Overview

```markdown
## Overview

The TaskAssignmentService encapsulates complex business logic for assigning tasks to users, including validation of assignment rules, calculation of workload distribution, and enforcement of business constraints that span multiple entities.

**Important**: This service is stateless and contains only pure business logic without any infrastructure dependencies.

The service operates on Task and User entities to determine valid assignments based on user availability, skill requirements, and workload balancing. It enforces business rules such as maximum concurrent tasks per user, skill matching requirements, and priority-based assignment logic.
```

### Domain Error Overview

```markdown
## Overview

The TaskNotFoundError represents the failure to locate a task by its identifier. This error is thrown when task lookup operations fail and provides context about the missing task for proper error handling and user feedback.

**Base Class**: Extends `DomainError` to inherit common functionality for error structure, serialization, and metadata handling.

The error includes the task identifier that was not found and provides a clear, user-friendly message explaining the failure. It enables proper error handling in use cases and controllers while maintaining consistency with the domain error hierarchy.
```

### Domain Event Overview

```markdown
## Overview

The TaskCreated event is emitted when a new task is successfully created in the system. This event represents the completion of the task creation process and signals that a new task entity has been added to the domain.

**Base Class**: Extends `BaseDomainEvent` to inherit common functionality for event structure, serialization, and immutability.

The event contains all relevant information about the newly created task, including its identifier, title, status, and creator. It enables event-driven architecture patterns and allows other parts of the system to react to task creation through event handlers.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing an overview section, ensure:

- [ ] Purpose statement is clear and specific
- [ ] Responsibilities are listed and described
- [ ] Domain role is explained
- [ ] Business context is provided
- [ ] Key characteristics are highlighted
- [ ] Base class reference is included (if applicable)
- [ ] Important notes are included (if applicable)
- [ ] Language uses domain terminology
- [ ] Content is comprehensive but concise
- [ ] Information is accurate and up-to-date

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Technical**: Avoid technical implementation details
2. **Too Vague**: Be specific about purpose and responsibilities
3. **Missing Context**: Explain why the component exists
4. **Inconsistent Language**: Use consistent terminology
5. **Missing Base Class**: Include base class reference when applicable
6. **Overly Long**: Keep overviews concise and focused
7. **Outdated Information**: Ensure content is current

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Purpose**: Begin with what the component does
2. **Use Domain Language**: Use business terminology consistently
3. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete details about capabilities
4. **Explain Context**: Help readers understand the business value
5. **Highlight Key Points**: Use formatting to emphasize important information
6. **Keep It Focused**: Stay on topic and avoid tangents
7. **Plan for Updates**: Structure for easy maintenance
