### Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL)

1. **Schema Management ↔ Content Authoring**: Translate between internal schema representation and editor-friendly formats
2. **Content Authoring ↔ Runtime Rendering**: Convert authoring concepts to runtime-optimized representations
3. **Deployment ↔ Runtime**: Transform deployment packages to runtime-consumable formats
4. **Analytics ↔ All Domains**: Normalize events and metrics from different domain contexts

### Shared Kernels

1. **Schema Definition Language**: Shared between Schema Management, Content Authoring, and Runtime Rendering
2. **Component Type System**: Common type definitions used across multiple domains
3. **Event Schema**: Standardized event format for analytics and monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

### Bounded Context Boundaries

- Each subdomain should have clear service boundaries
- Database per bounded context where feasible
- Event-driven communication between contexts
- Shared kernel elements require careful governance

### Team Organization

- Schema Management: Core platform team
- Content Authoring: Developer experience team
- Runtime Rendering: Platform-specific teams (Web, iOS, Android)
- Deployment: DevOps/Infrastructure team
- Administration: Platform/Security team
- Analytics: Data/Business intelligence team

### Evolution Strategy

- Start with Schema Management and Runtime Rendering as minimum viable domains
- Add Content Authoring for improved developer experience
- Expand with Deployment and Administration for enterprise features
- Analytics and Monitoring for operational maturity
